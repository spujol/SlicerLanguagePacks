The Slicer Language Packs extension enables the deployment and editing of multilingual translations in 3D Slicer.


## Getting Started

### Setup

- Download and onstall Qt toolkit. It is free. Go to [Qt website](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source), scroll down, click `Download the Qt online installer` button, and follow the instructions. Any Qt version can be used.
  - Qt is required because it contains the `lrelease` tool, which can compile a human-readable translation file(.ts file, that are edited on [Hosted Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/project/3d-slicer)) to a binary file (.qm file, that the application can use).
  - The Qt company added many misleading statements on its website to try to trick users into buying a commercial license of Qt.
  A commercial license is not needed, even for commercial uses of Qt. The free, open-source version is sufficient.
  - On macOS: installer can be downloaded from [here](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/online_installers/qt-unified-mac-x64-online.dmg) or Qt can be installed using Homebrew. If Homebrew is used then `lrelease` is available by default at `/usr/local/Cellar/qt@5/5.15.2/bin/lrelease`.
  - On Ubuntu, after downloading the Qt Installer from the website, open a terminal and move to the Downloads directory. Then, make the file executable (by changing the permissions) and then run the command "./[filename] to launch the installation. When the installation is done, the lrelease file will be located in "/usr/bin/" .
- [Download](https://download.slicer.org) and install a recent 3D Slicer Preview Release (released 2022-01-28 or later)
- Install SlicerLanguagePacks extension.

- In Slicer, go to `Language Tools` module and set `Qt lrelease tool path`. It is located in the folder where Qt was installed.
  - Default location on Windows is something like this: `c:\Qt\5.15.0\msvc2019_64\bin\lrelease.exe`

### Download and install latest translations

- Download latest translation
  - Option A: `Weblate`. Download selected langauges directly from Weblate. This allows getting the most recent translations immediately, which is useful for translators wanting to test their translated application immediately.
  - Option B: `GitHub`. Download all languages from [SlicerLanguageTranslations](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerLanguageTranslations) repository. This is the fastest way to get updated translation files for all languages, but these translations files are updated only once a day.
- Compile the translation files and install them into the application by clicking `Update translation files` button.
- Click `Restart the application` button to start using the new translation files.

### Set application language

Language can be selected in menu: Edit -> Application Settings, General section -> Language. If the language selector does not appear then go to "Internationalization" section and toggle the checkbox. The application has to be restarted after changing language.

For convenience, an application language selector is also added to the Language Tools module, below the `Update translation files` button. Any updated translation files immediately show up in this language selector.
